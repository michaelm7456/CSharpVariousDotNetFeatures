Containerize Your C# Application Easily with the .NET CLI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg0QVTS4Q0c

1.) First, open the path under the 'ContainerizedApplication' project.

2.) Next, run the below command inside your terminal/command prompt

dotnet publish --os linux --arch x64 -p:PublishProfile=DefaultContainer -c Release

3.) This will create your image, from which you can create a container.

4.) Within Docker Desktop, you can create a new Container by clicking 'Run' for the selected 'Image' under the 'Images' area, select port '0'.

5.) Once the Container is running, try navigating to the respective port number assigned by Docker to see your application running within the container.

Note: In the respective .cs project file, you can specify the Container family using the <ContainerFamily> tag, in case you wish to customise/adjust this to preference.
